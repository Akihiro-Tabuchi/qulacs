What to write
--------------


Core documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Consider writing a complete user manual to Qulacs,
for both programmer and physicists.


Application and research
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Consier this as pulishing a research paper, or a blog post by you, the writer.
Here we encourage contributors to use one single Jypter notebook file to illustrate a self contained idea using the software.
For example, answering a research question, developing a small algorithm, or a nice way to use Qulacs with other open source programs.


C++ API comments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The API reference is generated by special comment blocks written in the source code.


Python docstring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



Doc review
