Writing Qulacs documentation
====================================


Core documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider writing a complete user manual to Qulacs,
for both programmer and physicists.


Application and research
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Consider this as publishing a research paper, or a blog post by the contributor.
Here we encourage contributors to use one single Jupyter notebook or `.rst` file to illustrate a self contained idea using the software.
For example, answering a research question, developing a small algorithm, or a nice way to use Qulacs with other open source softwares,
or a best practice for getting the best performance.


C++ API comments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The API reference is generated by special comment blocks written in the source code.


Python docstring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



Proofreading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
